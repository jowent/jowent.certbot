Role Name
=========

Install certbot to manage certificates from Let's Encrypt

This is a simple role that installs the certbot package on Ubuntu and certbot's nginx plugin.
The final setup is not included.

Development of this is discontinued as my main usecase is for Plone deployments and the https://github.com/plone/ansible-playbook
now includes a certbot role which does a little bit more than this one.
